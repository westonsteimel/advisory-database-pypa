id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2025-1716
details: picklescan before 0.0.21 does not treat 'pip' as an unsafe global. An attacker
  could craft a malicious model that uses Pickle to pull in a malicious PyPI package
  (hosted, for example, on pypi.org or GitHub) via `pip.main()`. Because pip is not
  a restricted global, the model, when scanned with picklescan, would pass security
  checks and appear to be safe, when it could instead prove to be problematic.
