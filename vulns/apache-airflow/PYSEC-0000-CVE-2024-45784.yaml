id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-45784
details: Apache Airflow versions before 2.10.3 contain a vulnerability that could
  expose sensitive configuration variables in task logs. This vulnerability allows
  DAG authors to unintentionally or intentionally log sensitive configuration variables.
  Unauthorized users could access these logs, potentially exposing critical data that
  could be exploited to compromise the security of the Airflow deployment. In version
  2.10.3, secrets are now masked in task logs to prevent sensitive configuration variables
  from being exposed in the logging output. Users should upgrade to Airflow 2.10.3
  or the latest version to eliminate this vulnerability. If you suspect that DAG authors
  could have logged the secret values to the logs and that your logs are not additionally
  protected, it is also recommended that you update those secrets.
