id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2025-26622
details: vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. Vyper `sqrt()` builtin
  uses the babylonian method to calculate square roots of decimals. Unfortunately,
  improper handling of the oscillating final states may lead to sqrt incorrectly returning
  rounded up results. This issue is being addressed and a fix is expected in version
  0.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as the patched release is available.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
