id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-28237
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers.
  OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.9.3 contain a vulnerability that allows
  malicious admins to configure or talk a victim with administrator rights into configuring
  a webcam snapshot URL which when tested through the "Test" button included in the
  web interface will execute JavaScript code in the victims browser when attempting
  to render the snapshot image. An attacker who successfully talked a victim with
  admin rights into performing a snapshot test with such a crafted URL could use this
  to retrieve or modify sensitive configuration settings, interrupt prints or otherwise
  interact with the OctoPrint instance in a malicious way. The vulnerability is patched
  in version 1.10.0rc3. OctoPrint administrators are strongly advised to thoroughly
  vet who has admin access to their installation and what settings they modify based
  on instructions by strangers.
