id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2025-1979
details: "Versions of the package ray before 2.43.0 are vulnerable to Insertion of
  Sensitive Information into Log File where the redis password is being logged in
  the standard logging. If the redis password is passed as an argument, it will be
  logged and could potentially leak the password.\r\rThis is only exploitable if:\r\r1)
  Logging is enabled;\r\r2) Redis is using password authentication;\r\r3) Those logs
  are accessible to an attacker, who can reach that redis instance.\r\r**Note:**\r\rIt
  is recommended that anyone who is running in this configuration should update to
  the latest version of Ray, then rotate their redis password."
