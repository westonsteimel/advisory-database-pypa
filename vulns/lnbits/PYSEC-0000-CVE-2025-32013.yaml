id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2025-32013
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
details: LNbits is a Lightning wallet and accounts system. A Server-Side Request Forgery
  (SSRF) vulnerability has been discovered in LNbits' LNURL authentication handling
  functionality. When processing LNURL authentication requests, the application accepts
  a callback URL parameter and makes an HTTP request to that URL using the httpx library
  with redirect following enabled. The application doesn't properly validate the callback
  URL, allowing attackers to specify internal network addresses and access internal
  resources.
