id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-25112
details: 'Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting,
  and modifying the metadata of image files. A denial-of-service was found in Exiv2
  version v0.28.1: an unbounded recursion can cause Exiv2 to crash by exhausting the
  stack. The vulnerable function, `QuickTimeVideo::multipleEntriesDecoder`, was new
  in v0.28.0, so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The denial-of-service
  is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. This
  bug is fixed in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.'
